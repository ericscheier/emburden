# Controlled Release Workflow with Dual Approval Gates
#
# This workflow implements a secure release process with two manual approval
# checkpoints before publishing the package. It ensures that releases are
# thoroughly vetted and approved by multiple maintainers.
#
# SETUP REQUIRED:
# Before using this workflow, you must create two GitHub Environments:
#
# 1. "pre-release-review" environment:
#    - Go to Settings → Environments → New environment
#    - Name: pre-release-review
#    - Enable "Required reviewers"
#    - Add 1-2 reviewers who must approve before proceeding
#
# 2. "public-release" environment:
#    - Go to Settings → Environments → New environment
#    - Name: public-release
#    - Enable "Required reviewers"
#    - Add 1-2 DIFFERENT reviewers (for dual approval)
#    - Optional: Enable "Wait timer" for a cooling-off period
#    - NOTE: If you already have this environment, just verify it has required reviewers enabled
#
# USAGE:
# To trigger a release:
#   1. Push a git tag matching v* (e.g., v0.1.0, v1.2.3)
#      git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0"
#      git push origin v0.1.0
#   2. The workflow will automatically start
#   3. First approval gate: review validation results
#   4. Second approval gate: approve final release to CRAN/GitHub
#
# WORKFLOW STAGES:
# 1. Validation: Run all checks, tests, and build package tarball
# 2. GATE 1 (pre-release-review): Manual approval after reviewing validation
# 3. Pre-release: Create draft GitHub release with artifacts
# 4. GATE 2 (public-release): Final manual approval before publishing
# 5. Publish: Release to GitHub and optionally submit to CRAN

          NEXT STEPS (Manual):

          1. Verify Zenodo DOI appears on the release page
          2. If submitting to CRAN:
             - Download the package tarball from the release
             - Submit via https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html
             - Monitor CRAN submission status
          3. Announce the release:
             - Update package website if applicable
             - Social media announcements

          The package is now ready for CRAN submission.

          IMPORTANT: CRAN submissions must be done manually by the package maintainer.

          Steps to submit:

          1. Download the package tarball:
             https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/download/v${{ needs.validate.outputs.version }}/${{ needs.validate.outputs.tarball }}

          2. Review CRAN submission checklist:
             - R CMD check passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅
             - Package builds successfully ✅
             - All tests pass ✅
             - NEWS.md updated with version notes
             - DESCRIPTION file has correct maintainer email
             - All examples run successfully

          3. Submit to CRAN:
             - Go to: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html
             - Upload: ${{ needs.validate.outputs.tarball }}
             - Fill in submission form
             - Confirm maintainer email

          4. Monitor submission:
             - Check email for CRAN automated checks
             - Respond to any reviewer feedback
             - Typical review time: 2-7 days

          5. After CRAN acceptance:
             - Package appears on CRAN within 24 hours
             - Update README badges if needed
